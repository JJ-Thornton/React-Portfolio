Thank You for coming to look at the code! Before I break down the code more I'd Like to use this area for a little bit more about me. During 2020 everyone faced hardships on a global scale. For me it was equally difficult and a near fatal accident made it that much harder. In May 2020 I fell off a cliff, after 3.5 weeks in the hospital, full reconstuctive facial surgery, loss of site in my left eye, and 6 months of recovery staring me down. I now was unable to go back to my previous job and needed to figure something out. With nothing but months of sitting ahead I decided to use the time to learn coding. These things are the result of that time. I didn't want to clutter my actual portfolio with this, but I did want to talk about it a little bit. Back to the code.

This site is made to be a stepping stone, while now it functions as a static site with little use of reacts full capabilities, as other projects I am working on become completed this provides a great foundation to apply them to.

Pages broken up into components allow for easy editing and replacment, rather than sifting through lines and lines of html to find the section I need.

Class based components add further ease in adding functionality to the app as well as implementing machine learning to certain features so that based on you the site will filter and select the best examples of work for what youre interested in.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
