          In the aftermath of the pandemic I turned my focus to find something I
          truly loved doing. After several attempts I found that coding was the
          thing I enjoyed the most, starting with <span>HTML</span>, then{' '}
          <span>Javascript</span>, I found
          <span> CSS</span> and fell in love. The challenges and problem solving
          are my favorite part of coding. In my free time I like to play with my
          dog, Dakota, while I continue to wait for my Hogwarts letter.
